# kc-repl

`kc-repl` (Apache **K**afka **C**onsumer [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)) is
an interactive tool for exploring Apache Kafka clusters.  It features:
* The ability to arbitrarily subscribe to any topics/partitions in the cluster (and remove those assignments)
* The ability to jump around to different offsets at will (either in relative terms, absolute terms, or by consuming
    the data and evaluating a predicate)
* The ability to provide arbitrary map and reduce functions over the records over any polling based operation

## Installation

## Usage

### Clojure REPL
This is the most fully-featured and powerful way to run `kc-repl`.  You will need install the latest (1.11+) version of
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/releases/downloads).  Then, clone this repo and run:

`clojure -M:run /path/to/your/kafka.consumer.properties`

After it starts, you should see output like the following

    2022-09-27 16:22:43 INFO  AppInfoParser:119 - Kafka version: 3.1.0
    2022-09-27 16:22:43 INFO  AppInfoParser:120 - Kafka commitId: 37edeed0777bacb3
    2022-09-27 16:22:43 INFO  AppInfoParser:121 - Kafka startTimeMs: 1664313763331
    2022-09-27 16:22:43 INFO  kc-repl:326 - Welcome to kc-repl!
    nREPL server started on port 61670 on host localhost - nrepl://localhost:61670
    nREPL 1.0.0
    Clojure 1.11.1
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.0.1.1+0
    Interrupt: Control+C
    Exit:      Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
    user=>

At this point, you can begin running functions to explore the data.  Simply run `(help)` to see the full list of
operations supported.

#### Usage Examples

Suppose you have a Kafka topic called `test-data` with a single partition, and messages in JSON (string) format like
```json lines
{"foo": 1}
{"foo": 1}
...
{"foo": 100}
```

The following REPL session shows how you can explore the data in this topic.

```clojure
;; see what topics we have
user=> (list-topics)
["test-data"]
;; read 5 messages from the test-data topic, partition 0, offset 0, in json format
user=> (read-from "test-data" 0 0 5 "json")
[{"foo" 1} {"foo" 2} {"foo" 3} {"foo" 4} {"foo" 5}]
;; skip forward by 20
(seek+ 20)
;; poll two more messages, in json format
user=> (seek+ 20)
:us.jeffevans.kc-repl/ok
user=> (poll 2 "json")
[{"foo" 26} {"foo" 27}]
;; check where we are now
user=> (print-assignments)
test-data:0 at 27
nil
```

There are also some more advanced capabilities (including `seek-while` and `seek-until`).  More details will be added
to the doc on using those, but for now, you can refer to the test cases for more advanced usage.

### Java (uberjar)

There is an uberjar build of `kc-repl` that is capable of running basic operations using `java`.  To use this mode,
download (or build) the uberjar, then run:

`java -Dclojure.core.async.pool-size=1 -jar kc-repl-*.jar /path/to/consumer.properties`

The syntax for the Java runtime is more similar to the original Kafka command line tools.  You can type `help` for a
more complete list.

### Library

`kc-repl` can also be used as a library from other Clojure/Java applications.  For examples of how this can work, refer
to the tests in `us.jeffevans.kc-repl-test`. 

## Development

### Implementation

An instance of the `KCRClient` record represents the main client object.  It encapsulates a
[`KafkaConsumer`](https://kafka.apache.org/32/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html) to read
records from the configured cluster.  The code attempts to ensure this `KafkaConsumer` is well-behaved (i.e. running
a `poll` at a regular cadence regardless of how quickly the user is typing commands).

The core operations that involve iterating over or polling records do so via a
[transducer](https://clojure.org/reference/transducers) over an "infinite sequence" of records
from the stream.  The final composed function of the transducer is a special one that updates the client's
offsets to match what was just consumed (for cases where we don't know until reading a record that we are "done"
advancing, such as `seek-while` and `seek-until`).

#### Extension

The current key and message types that can be parsed are limited (only text and JSON).  There is a multimethod,
`parse-type`, that provides an extension point through which parsing of new types can be supported.  In the future,
support for some of these will be added to this project (as submodules that can be built separately and loaded as
needed).  In theory, any Clojure code that defines a new method for this multimethod can take advantage of this
mechanism to read additional types (provided the bytecode is available on the classpath).

### Building the Uberjar
`clojure -J-Dclojure.core.async.pool-size=1 -T:build ci`

### Testing
`clojure -J-Dclojure.core.async.pool-size=1 -X:test`

### Roadmap and Bugs

Bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked in the GitHub project (via issues).
