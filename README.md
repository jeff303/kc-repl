# kc-repl

`kc-repl` (Apache **K**afka **C**onsumer [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)) is
an interactive tool for exploring Apache Kafka clusters.  It features:
* The ability to arbitrarily subscribe to any topics/partitions in the cluster (and remove those assignments)
* The ability to jump around to different offsets at will (either in relative terms, absolute terms, or by consuming
    the data and evaluating a predicate)
* The ability to provide arbitrary map and reduce functions over the records over any polling based operation

## Usage

### Clojure REPL
This is the most fully-featured and powerful way to run `kc-repl`.  You will need install the latest (1.11+) version of
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/releases/downloads).  Then, clone this repo and run:

`clojure -M:run /path/to/your/kafka.consumer.properties`

After it starts, you should see output like the following

    2022-09-27 16:22:43 INFO  AppInfoParser:119 - Kafka version: 3.1.0
    2022-09-27 16:22:43 INFO  AppInfoParser:120 - Kafka commitId: 37edeed0777bacb3
    2022-09-27 16:22:43 INFO  AppInfoParser:121 - Kafka startTimeMs: 1664313763331
    2022-09-27 16:22:43 INFO  kc-repl:326 - Welcome to kc-repl!
    nREPL server started on port 61670 on host localhost - nrepl://localhost:61670
    nREPL 1.0.0
    Clojure 1.11.1
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.0.1.1+0
    Interrupt: Control+C
    Exit:      Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
    user=>

At this point, you can begin running functions to explore the data.  Simply run `(help)` to see the full list of
operations supported.

#### Usage Examples

Suppose you have a Kafka topic called `test-data` with a single partition, and messages in JSON (string) format like
```json lines
{"foo": 1}
{"foo": 1}
...
{"foo": 100}
```

The following REPL session shows how you can explore the data in this topic.

```clojure
;; see what topics we have
user=> (list-topics)
["test-data"]
;; read 5 messages from the test-data topic, partition 0, offset 0, in json format
user=> (read-from "test-data" 0 0 5 "json")
[{"foo" 1} {"foo" 2} {"foo" 3} {"foo" 4} {"foo" 5}]
;; skip forward by 20
user=> (seek+ 20)
:us.jeffevans.kc-repl/ok
;; poll two more messages, in json format
user=> (poll 2 "json")
[{"foo" 26} {"foo" 27}]
;; check where we are now
user=> (print-assignments)
test-data:0 at 27
nil
```

##### Advanced Record Handling

In the examples above, a single message handling option was given, and it was a string (`json`).  In this case,
the string is interpreted as the type of message value (in this case, a JSON payload encoded as a UTF-8 string).

`kc-repl` supports passing a map as this parameter value instead, which provides much more complete control over
record handling.

```clojure

{::kcr/key-type         "json"       ; the format the key should be parsed in (optional)
 ::kcr/key-parse-fn     (fn [b] nil) ; a custom function to parse the key (passed as a byte array)
                                     ; if both are omitted, the key won't be parsed
 ::kcr/value-type       "json"       ; the format the value should be parsed in (optional)
 ::kcr/value-parse-fn   (fn [b] nil) ; a custom function to parse the value (passed as a byte array)
                                     ; if both are omitted, the value won't be parsed
 ::kcr/key->clj?          true       ; if true, the key will be converted to a Clojure map after parsing the bytes
 ::kcr/val->clj?          true       ; if true, the value will be converted to a Clojure map after parsing the bytes 
 ::kcr/include-headers?   true       ; whether to include message headers in extra-metadata
 ::kcr/include-offset?    true       ; whether to include the message offset in extra-metadata
 ::kcr/include-partition? true       ; whether to include the PartitionInfo in extra-metadata
 ::kcr/include-timestamp? true       ; whether to include the timestamp in extra-metadata
 ::kcr/include-topic?     true       ; whether to include the topic name in extra-metadata
 ;; reducing-fn is called at the end of the transducer, after the polling operation is complete
 ;; used to aggregate results
 ::kcr/reducing-fn      (fn ([]  ; init (0) arity
                             {}) ; initialize the blank accumulator
                          ([acc] ; completion (1) arity
                           nil)  ; return the final result (probably from accumulator)
                          ([acc mapped-record] ; step (2) arity
                           nil))               ; apply the mapped-record to the accumulator
 ;; map-record-fn is called once for each ConsumerRecord
 ;; it will be passed two parameters:
 ;;  - the ConsumerRecord (passed directly from the underlying KafkaConsumer), and
 ;;  - a map containing any extra metadata that might be available...
 ;;    - the parsed message key, under ::kcr/parsed-key (if available)
 ;;    - the parsed message value, under ::kcr/parsed-value (if available)
 ;;    - the offset, PartitionInfo, timestamp, header, or topic if requested (see above)
 ;; the output of this function is referred to as the mapped-record, and is passed along to the
 ;; rest of the processing pipeline (the predicate functions for seek-while/seek-until, the reducing-fn)
 ::kcr/map-record-fn    (fn [^ConsumerRecord cr extra-metadata]
                          {::order parsed-value, ::headers headers, ::offset offset})}
```

Here is an example `kc-repl` session showing some of these capabilities.  Suppose we have random "Orders" data
generated by the [Confluent Datagen Source Connector](https://www.confluent.io/hub/confluentinc/kafka-connect-datagen).
For reference, here are a couple of sample records that it generates (in JSON format, for our case).

```json
{"ordertime": 1495239240320,
  "orderid": 0,
  "itemid": "Item_546",
  "orderunits": 2.779222985601741,
  "address": {"city": "City_72", "state": "State_16", "zipcode": 58684}}
```

Suppose we want to find which zipcodes had at least two orders within the first 1000 orders.

```clojure
;; define a null-safe inc function
(defn- safe-inc [x]
  (if (nil? x) 1 (inc x)))
;; add the orders-json topic assignment, partition 0, offset 0
(assign "orders-json" 0 0)
;; run the polling operation, using the map-record-fn and reducing-fn
(poll
  1000
  {::kcr/value-type    "json"
   ::kcr/reducing-fn   (fn ([] ; init (0) arity
                               {})
                            ([acc] ; completion (1) arity
                             (reduce-kv (fn [acc* zip tot]
                                          (if (> tot 1)
                                            (assoc acc* zip tot)
                                            acc*))
                                        {}
                                        acc))
                            ([acc {:keys [::order]}] ; step (2) arity
                             (update acc (get-in order ["address" "zipcode"]) safe-inc)))
   ::kcr/map-record-fn (fn [_ {:keys [::kcr/parsed-value ::kcr/headers ::kcr/offset]}]
                            {::order parsed-value, ::headers headers, ::offset offset})})

=> {99859 2, 40612 2, 77762 2}
```

A similar approach can be taken with `seek-while` and `seek-until` (ex: if the exact number of records isn't known
ahead of time).  Any elements from the `ConsumerRecord` that aren't needed for the rest of the processing or filtering
can simply be ignored/not passed along from the `map-record-fn`

### Java (uberjar)

There is an uberjar build of `kc-repl` that is capable of running basic operations using `java`.  To use this mode,
download (or build) the uberjar, then run:

#### Without Custom Type Handlers

```shell
java -Dclojure.core.async.pool-size=1 -jar target/kc-repl-<version>-standalone.jar /path/to/client.properties
```

#### With Custom Type Handlers
```shell
rlwrap java -Dclojure.core.async.pool-size=1 -cp type-handlers/avro/target/kc-repl-type-handler-avro-<version>-avro-handler.jar:target/kc-repl-<version>-standalone.jar us.jeffevans.kc_repl.java_main /path/to/client.properties
```

The syntax for the Java runtime is more similar to the original Kafka command line tools.  You can type `help` for a
more complete list.

### Library

`kc-repl` can also be used as a library from other Clojure/Java applications.  For examples of how this can work, refer
to the tests in `us.jeffevans.kc-repl-test`. 

## Development

### Implementation

An instance of the `KCRClient` record represents the main client object.  It encapsulates a
[`KafkaConsumer`](https://kafka.apache.org/32/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html) to read
records from the configured cluster.  The code attempts to ensure this `KafkaConsumer` is well-behaved (i.e. running
a `poll` at a regular cadence regardless of how quickly the user is typing commands).

The core operations that involve iterating over or polling records do so via a
[transducer](https://clojure.org/reference/transducers) over an "infinite sequence" of records
from the stream.  The final composed function of the transducer is a special one that updates the client's
offsets to match what was just consumed (for cases where we don't know until reading a record that we are "done"
advancing, such as `seek-while` and `seek-until`).

#### Extension

The base implementation supports type handling for text and json data.  Additional type handlers can be added by:
* extending the `us.jeffevans.kc-repl.type-handlers/type-handler` protocol
* defining a `us.jeffevans.kc-repl.type-handlers/create-type-handler` multimethod implementation
* adding a `kc-repl-handler-ns.txt` file to your classpath (ex: in `resources`) that indicates the namespace that
  should be loaded to allow for this type handler to be picked up at runtime

Refer to the `avro` and `protobuf` implementations under `type-handlers` for reference implementations.
